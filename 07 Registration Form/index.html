        <!-- Specifying the type attribute of a form element is important for the browser to know what kind of data it should expect. If the type is not specified, the browser will default to text. -->

        <!--  To make the form more interactive, add the required attribute to the input elements in the first fieldset. Now, if you try to submit the form without filling in the required fields, you will see an error message.-->

        <!-- With form submissions, it is useful, and good practice, to provide each submittable element with a name attribute. This attribute is used to identify the element in the form submission. -->
        <label for="first-name"
          >Enter Your First Name:
          <input id="first-name" name="first-name" type="text" required

          >Enter Your Last Name:
          <input id="last-name" name="last-name" type="text" required
        /></label>
        <!-- Certain type attribute values come with built-in form validation. For example, type="email" requires that the value be a valid email address. -->
        <label for="email"
          >Enter Your Email:
          <input id="email" name="email" type="email" required
        /></label>

        <!-- You only want one radio input to be selectable at a time. However, the form does not know the radio inputs are related. To relate the radio inputs, give them the same name attribute with a value of account-type. Now, it is not possible to select both radio inputs at the same time. -->

        <!-- Using "required with input tags for radio buttons won't work. You can provide context of what is needed by adding a legend element with text "Account type (required)" before the label elements within the second fieldset. Then add the checked attribute to the "Personal" input to ensure the form is submitted with the required data in it.-->

        <!--  Follow accessibility best practices by linking the input elements and the label elements in the second fieldset. Use personal-account, and business-account as values for the respective id attributes.-->
