/* With hex colors, 00 is 0% of that color, and FF is 100%. So #00FF00 translates to 0% red, 100% green, and 0% blue, and is the same as rgb(0, 255, 0). 

The CSS hsl function accepts 3 values: a number from 0 to 360 for hue, a percentage from 0 to 100 for saturation, and a percentage from 0 to 100 for lightness.

If you imagine a color wheel, the hue red is at 0 degrees, green is at 120 degrees, and blue is at 240 degrees.

Saturation is the intensity of a color from 0%, or gray, to 100% for pure color. You must add the percent sign % to the saturation and lightness values.

Lightness is how bright a color appears, from 0%, or complete black, to 100%, complete white, with 50% being neutral.

A gradient is when one color transitions into another. The CSS linear-gradient function lets you control the direction of the transition along a line, and which colors are used.

One thing to remember is that the linear-gradient function actually creates an image element, and is usually paired with the background property which can accept an image as a value.

syntax: linear-gradient(gradientDirection, color1, color2, ...);

gradientDirection is the direction of the line used for the transition. color1 and color2 are color arguments, which are the colors that will be used in the transition itself. These can be any type of color, including color keywords, hex, rgb, or hsl.

Color-stops allow you to fine-tune where colors are placed along the gradient line. They are a length unit like px or percentages that follow a color in the linear-gradient function.

For example, in this red-black gradient, the transition from red to black takes place at the 90% point along the gradient line, so red takes up most of the available space.

Even without the color-stops, you might have noticed that the colors for the green marker transition at the same points as the red marker. The first color is at the start (0%), the second is in the middle (50%), and the last is at the end (100%) of the gradient line.

The linear-gradient function automatically calculates these values for you, and places colors evenly along the gradient line by default.

If no gradientDirection argument is provided to the linear-gradient function, it arranges colors from top to bottom, or along a 180 degree line, by default.

With the CSS opacity property, you can control how opaque or transparent an element is. With the value 0, or 0%, the element will be completely transparent, and at 1.0, or 100%, the element will be completely opaque like it is by default.

To add an alpha channel to an rgb color, use the rgba function instead. The rgba function works just like the rgb function, but takes one more number from 0 to 1.0 for the alpha channel.

The box-shadow property lets you apply one or more shadows around an element. Here is basic syntax:

box-shadow: offsetX offsetY color;

If you wanted to position your shadow on the opposite side, use negative values for offsetX and offsetY.

There is an optional blurRadius value for the box-shadow property: box-shadow: offsetX offsetY blurRadius color;

If a blurRadius value isn't included, it defaults to 0 and produces sharp edges. The higher the value of blurRadius, the greater the blurring effect is.
